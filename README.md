# Convexity Adjustment_Final_Thesis
Final degree project, "Variance and Volatility Swaps Under the Lens: The Role of Convexity Adjustment". This work focuses on how volatility path roughness impacts the convexity adjustment for volatility swaps.
Here you can see the Monte Carlo simulations we ran divided into the 3 parts of our thesis; under the classical SABR model, the ... and Cholesky decomposition with fractional Brownian motion (under rough SABR model).
